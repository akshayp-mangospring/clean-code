### **What's the idea of clean code?**
I haven't invented the idea, it's been around in the software development world for a long time. Pioneers of the idea include Kent Beck, Robert Martin, Ward Cunningham, etc. Whatever that I have learnt about the idea about clean code is from the book 'Clean Code', 'Refactoring'.

### What does clean code mean?
Many definitions can be derived from it. But I chose - A code which is elegant, maintainable and has no room for unrequired optimisation.

### **Expected Attitude**:
* Boy scouts rule:
'Leave the camp ground cleaner than you found out.' This principle generally derives itself from fear of code ownership. Get ourselves rid of the myth that - Once you touch code then it's yours. No. It's system's code.
* Clean Code is a habit rather than an acquired skill.

### **Parts of clean code:**
1. Refactoring
2. Test Driven Development
3. Code Organization and Code Design
